1. Join our Discord channel [here](https://discord.gg/ggDH3G8ng2) for related discussions and alignment.
2. Check out our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/eeNDR0K2/free-internet) and pick up tasks that are aligned with your skills and start working on them.

## How to propose new idea and showcase it

If you have new ideas, you can discuss them on our Discord channel or open an issue for it. If enough people gather around your idea, you can start working on it and open PRs for it. Please make sure you use the `new-idea` label on your issue.

If you have implemented something to showcase, please open a PR with the tag `showcase` so we can check it out. Also, it is nice to have a screenshot or video to present the way it works.
